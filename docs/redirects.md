# Redirects

Redirects have many uses, not just for SEO and marketing but also for migrating sites or moving content around.

The redirects component is built for performance and scale by using indexed data in the CMS database. They can be exported and
imported using standard WXR format files.

## Whitelisting redirect hosts

For security purposes redirects only work within the current host name by default. To redirect to other domains external to the
current host use the following filter:

```php
add_filter( 'allowed_redirect_hosts', function ( array $hosts ) : array {
    $hosts[] = 'example.com';
    return $hosts;
}, 10 );
```

## CLI commands

```shell
wp hm-redirects find-domains
```

Extracts a list of unique target domains from your existing redirects. This is useful for populating the `allowed_redirect_hosts`
filter.

```shell
wp hm-redirects insert-redirect <from-url> <to-url>
```

Adds a redirect rule.

```shell
wp hm-redirects import-from-csv --csv=<path-to-csv> [--verbose]
```

Imports redirects from a CSV file. The file must have 2 columns, column 1 being the "from" URL and column 2 being to the "to" URL.
The "to" URL can be a full URL, a relative path or an existing post ID.

```shell
wp hm-redirects import-from-meta --meta_key=<name-of-meta-key> [--start=<start-offset>] [--end=<end-offset>] [--dry_run]
 [--verbose]
```

If you have existing redirect URLs or paths stored as metadata on posts, you can use this command to migrate to the more efficient
structure.
